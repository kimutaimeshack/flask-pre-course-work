#Tuples are like lists. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable - their values cannot be changed once created.

tuple_a = ("a", "b", "c", "d")  # tuple of strings
tuple_b = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  # tuple of numbers
tuple_c = (1, "west", 34, "longitude")  # mixed tuple
tuple_d = tuple()  #empty tuple
